write a class to calculate the uber price.

Code class Uber {
  constructor(person,location,distance,charge,totalprice) {
    this.person = person;
    this.location =  location;
    this.distance = distance;
    this.charge = charge;
    
  }

  gettravel() {
    return "HI "+this.person+" your location is "+this.location;
  }
}
var c1=new Uber("Bala","Chennai");
console.log(c1.gettravel());
 this.distance= 55;
console.log("Travelled distance",this.distance)
 this.charge= 10;
console.log("Charge per KM",this.charge)
this.price=this.distance*this.charge;
console.log("total fare is",this.price);



O/P HI Bala your location is Chennai
Travelled distance 55
Charge per KM 10
